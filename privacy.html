        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>names</li>
            <li>email addresses</li>
            <li>mailing addresses</li>

            of any changes to such personal information.

            Information automatically collected

            In Short: Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device
            characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.

            We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information
            does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and
            usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
            preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our
            Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
            operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

            Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.

            The information we collect includes:
            Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information
            our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files.
            Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information,
            browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps
            associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which
            features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash
            dumps'), and hardware settings).
            Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device
            you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such

            hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration
            information.
            Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be
            either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device
            you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation
            data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
            collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting
            on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
            Services.

        <h3>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
        <p>
            In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid
            legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws,
            to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or
            to fulfil our legitimate business interests.

            <u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u>

            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we
            rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to
            process your personal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your
                personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to
                learn more.</li>
            <li>Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to
                fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to
                entering into a contract with you.</li>
            <li>Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to
                achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and
                fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the
                purposes described in order to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>
                    <li>Develop and display personalised and relevant advertising content for our users</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with
                our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise
                or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
                involved.</li>
            <li>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital
                interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the
                safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.

            We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your
            personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.
            implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#">here</a> to learn more.

            In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
            without your consent, including, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely
                way</li>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met </li>
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle
                an insurance claim </li>
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin </li>
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
            </li>
            <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
                accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
                breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province </li>
            <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court
                relating to the production of records </li>
            <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
                collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced </li>
            <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes </li>
            <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations </li>

            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete

            consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details

        <h3>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES </h3>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT')
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising
            and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
            or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
            for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
            a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
